                  Flowers drop during high & cooler temperatures following
                  blossom set can also lead to healthy blossoms falling off.
                  Insufficient light, whether it's too much or too little, can
                  also contribute to healthy flowers dropping off plants.

                  Check for insects by looking at the underside of leaves.Avoid
                  plants with drought stress, indicated by yellow foliage.Be
                  sure your container has a drainage hole in it, since plants
                  don't like to sit in water.Add gravel to the bottom of the pot
                  if it has no holes, and set the plant on top of the rocks.

                  Pale or yellow leaves can indicate several things. Are those
                  leaves at the base of the plant, i.e. older leaves. If they
                  fall off, the plant might not be receiving enough water. If it
                  is sufficiently watered, it may be missing nitrogen. Add
                  compost or fertilizer to the soil around the plant.

                  On average, mature plants should be repotted less frequently
                  than young, faster-growing plants. Young plants may need to be
                  repotted every 12 to 18 months, yet older plants that grow
                  more slowly may be repotted every 2 to 3 years, or as needed.

                  Underwatering is one cause of why plants may be exhibiting dry
                  and crispy leaves. Often times, if you let your houseplant's
                  soil get bone dry, especially for extended periods, the lower
                  leaves will typically turn brown and crispy. Either just the
                  edges, or even the whole leaf.

                  The most common cause of fungus gnats in plants is
                  overwatering, so be sure to let your soil dry out in between
                  waterings as often as possible. Check the soil with your
                  finger every few days and once you feel it starting to get
                  dry, leave it like that for about a week to keep gnats away.
